================

An attempt at a header file, or maybe a script, to make an API for logging changes made to shared state through pthreads. The intent is to visualize and perhaps help debug race conditions/deadlock/livelock/premature death by concurrent task handling.

Let's try a header file first.

That didn't work out so well. Onwards to perl.
